1- install all the neccessary packages using this command:
"npm i" if an error occured try to force the command by using the "--force" flag

you will need to use credentials from 'https://fakestoreapi.com/docs#u-all'
or you can use this one:

username: 'johnd'
password: 'm38rmF$'

you will get directed to dashboard where you can navigate to products and categories modules

one thing to take care of while exploring the code base=>
you can find the products component inside the dashboard folder as i made a mistake by naming it for the first place
